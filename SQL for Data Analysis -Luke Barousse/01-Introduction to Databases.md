# Introduction to Databases

A database is a storage system on your computer or a server that allows you to store massive amounts of data in them. Databases store data in a clean and efficient manner that's based on tables that consist of rows and columns which makes storing, managing and retrieving data faster and easier especially if you're working with a huge database with thousands of records.

There are many types of databases but the most commonly used is SQL-based also known as relational databases that store data in tables that are made of rows and columns like an excel spreadsheet, while an excel file can only store 1 million rows of data, databases don't have this constraint and can store data based on the storage given to the database engine by the database administrator.

## Types of Databases

There many other types of databases that aren't table based on tables and can store data in multiple types of formats. NoSQL stands for not-only SQL meaning that these databases can hold more data types such as files, images, and even full-length movies in them which is known as unstructured data.

NoSQL databases are also getting more and more popular as the amount of data being generated by humans, IoT devices and online interactions increase more and more.
NoSQL databases include:

- Column based
- graph based
- document based
- key-value pair based
