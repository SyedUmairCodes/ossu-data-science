Most general users experience most of their AR content on their mobile devices. 

It ranges from face filters in Instagram and Snapchat to testing how the new IKEA desk would look like in your room without even going to IKEA or seeing how a dress would look on you without trying it on.

Sportsmen like golfers and baseball can benefit from AR that helps them improve their performance by showing them their launch angle and velocity before and after taking the shot so that they can analyze their performance.
