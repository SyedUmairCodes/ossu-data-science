Extended reality or XR is the term used to describe all the other technologies that we can use to combine the physical and digital worlds. XR can be thought as an spectrum or an
continuum.

Augmented Reality is the oldest technology in the XR family and it has been around for quite a while now. It's easy to access and doesn't need any special hardware and is considered the baseline on the XR spectrum.

AR is most commonly used for digital filters that allow you to add special and life-like effects on top of your photos and videos.

Augmented virtuality (AV) is also a technology that falls into the XR spectrum and is similar to AR but is lesser known.

The background filters that you and other people use to change your surrounding background online video calls and conferences are examples of AV.

> Augmented reality brings things from the digital world to the physical and Augmented virtuality brings things from the real world to the digital one.

Mixed reality is in the middle between AR an AV and it blends both the worlds and combines both the features of AR and AV together. 

MR is generally used for enterprise level applications and many luxury car designers use MR headsets to look and design the interior and exterior of their super cars with other designers and engineers.

MR is also used in aeronautics and for building rockets since it can enable engineers to design even the smallest part easily and they can see how it would fit in the rocket in real life.

Virtual reality or VR sits at the top of the XR spectrum and provides a fully immersive digital experience that allows you to be truly absorbed and engaged in the digital world.

> VR allows you to totally turn off the real world and be truly present in the virtual world of your choice.
