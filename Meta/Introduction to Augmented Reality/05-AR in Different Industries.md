In the marketing realm, AR can be used to help customers visualize products in their own homes or businesses. 

A furniture company could use AR to allow customers to see how a couch would look in their living room, or a paint company could use AR to allow customers to see how a new color would look on their walls.

> In the education realm, AR can be used to create more immersive and engaging learning experiences.

Students could use AR to explore the inside of a human body, or to travel back in time to see historical events firsthand.
