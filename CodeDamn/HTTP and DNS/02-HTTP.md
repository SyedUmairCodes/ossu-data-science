# Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP is the protocol used by web browsers to send or accept requests.

Their are certain rules that both the server and the computer have to follow for a request to be successful. HTTP is a plain-text protocol so the requests that we make and the response that we get from the server are in a human readable format most of the times in JSON.
