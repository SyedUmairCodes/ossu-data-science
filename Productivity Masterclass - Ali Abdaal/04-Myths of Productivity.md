There are many different myths that people have come up with around productivity and most of them are false and most just an excuse to not work.

## Not Enough Time
The most common excuse for not doing work that a person needed to do is that they didn't have enough time to do it. Which is totally wrong in a sense that all human beings get 24 hours in a day and how you choose to spend those 24 hours is up to you.

You can finish your required tasks and then go to the gym or take a walk outside, or even cook a nice dinner but most people would rather prefer takeout, watching Netflix, and scrolling through social media.

> You already have the time to do everything you want to do. It's just you choose not to do it.

## Not Enough Motivation
The second myth is also kind of made up, people don't work towards there goals that they set because they don't see an immediate result and feel like they haven't made any progress at all and give up half way,

Motivation isn't the thing that you should use an excuse because motivation is just a little burst of energy that everyone gets when we are relaxed and excited for something. Once that burst of energy dies down then we're back to our old selves again.

Instead of using Motivation as a fuel source for achieving your goals make it a habit of doing the same task every day and be consistent with completing it.

Being consistent is what will give you the results you want the fastest and will make you feel more motivated towards completing your goals and the more goals you complete the more motivated you'll become.

## Don't Multitask
Human brains are not made for doing multiple things at once and multitasking may seem like it's a great way to increase our productivity but in reality it's not.

If you focus on a single task at a time and give all you attention to that task then you'll enter your flow state. The flow state is the state in which your body and mind are at their peek performance levels and your productivity is also at it's peak.

Multitasking doesn't let this happen because whenever you switch tasks you also shift your mental context and the brain needs time to adapt to this new context which also decreases your productivity.
