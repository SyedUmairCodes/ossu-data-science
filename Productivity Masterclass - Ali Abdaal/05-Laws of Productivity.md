There are many different scientific laws that we can use in our daily lives in order to increase our productivity. 
## Parkinson's Law
This law states that work will expand over time that we have allocated it. Meaning that the more time you give to complete a task the more time it will take to complete it.

Parkinson's law helps us to boost our productivity by assigning ourselves "artificial" deadlines. Complete an assignment today whose deadline is next week, by doing this we are generating more useful output in the least amount of time and are not letting our work expand over time.

## Pareto's Principle
Pareto's principle suggests that 80% of our work can be completed in just 20% of the effort. 

The pareto principle blends into productivity easily because if you are studying for an upcoming test it's a proven fact that 80% of the test questions will come from the 20% of the syllabus which is the core part of that subject.

## First Law of Motion
Newton's first law of motion is also applicable to productivity and how we can increase it.

> An object will stay at rest or travel at a constant velocity until a external forced is applied on it.

This means if we are procrastinating we will continue to procrastinate until our deadline comes close or someone tells us to get back to work. This can also be used in the opposite way as well.

## Two and Five Minute Rules
The two minute rule states that if a task can be completed in less than two minutes then it should be done immediately and if left undone this two minute tasks could pile up and become  2+ hours of work.

The five minute rule states that if there is any task that needs to be completed but we aren't in a mood to complete it then just try working on it for five minutes as this tricks the brain into concentrating on the task and eventually completing it,
