# Both Skills Matter

A professional that has been working in his field for over a year or so will pick up a lot of knowledge and experience and when he has to solve a problem he will focus on his knowledge and experience that he has gained over the years before reaching out to others or look for an external solution.

But, this knowledge and experience can only help him with his technical problems that occur and not with a problem that has occurred between him and another collogue or manager.  To solve these kinds of problems he will need to use his soft skills that consist of having the ability to communicate well with others and handling pressure and managing and even leading teams.

>Hard skills help you solve technical problems and soft skills help you solve people problems.
