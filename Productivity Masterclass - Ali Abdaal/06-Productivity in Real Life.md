## Healthy Habits
One of the best ways to be productive is to make a daily task such as handling emails into a habit. Pick a time in your day and manage your emails daily at that time so that you don't have a huge inbox filled with thousands of emails that need to be responded to.

> Building good habits is not a temporary goal but to build a better routine and overall self-image.

## Productive Downtime
You'll see that most people will have all the time in the world and will automatically be doing more than it looks like. This is because they make their down time into productive time as well.

Down time is the break you take between tasks, if you have sent an email to someone and need their response before continuing your work read a book or article that interests you instead of scrolling social media or playing games on your phone while you wait.

## Productive Procrastination
If you have a deadline to meet at the end of the month then the best thing would be get started right now as you could complete your task before the deadline and create more useful output.

But, like most people you'll probably procrastinate and while procrastinating isn't ideal it doesn't have to be bad. You can learn more about your task by watching videos on YouTube about it instead of cat videos.

If you can make your procrastination period into productive time then you'll be more productive than ever.
