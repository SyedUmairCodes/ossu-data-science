Smart contracts are turing complete meaning that they can perform any operation that the user wants and they can code the operation into them.

In order for smart contracts to replace a traditional contract the Blockchain would need the data required for it and on it's own the Blockchain and the smart contract both cannot interact with the real world or the internet to get the data that they need.

Oracle's are the solution to this problem. An oracle is any device or platform that can provide a Blockchain platform the external data and computational resources that it needs for different types of smart contracts.
