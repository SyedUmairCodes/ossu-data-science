Oracles are a great way to add functionality to a Blockchain platform on-demand but if we only use a single oracle then we lose the de-centralized aspect since all of the external data is coming from only a single source.

We need to use a de-centralized oracle network that works similar to our Blockchain platform so that both the on-chain and off-chain logic can be de-centralized.

> Hybrid smart contracts are the smart contracts that use both de-centralized on-chain and off-chain data and computational resources.

Most modern Blockchain protocols use hybrid smart contracts to some extent.
