After the success of Bitcoin, Vitalik Buterin and other developers released their own protocol which they called Ethereum and they also used Blockchain technology as their base.

The thing that makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin is that Ethereum is more than a P2P transaction system. Ethereum can make de-centralized transactions like Bitcoin but can also make de-centralized agreements and organizations as well.

> De-centralized agreements are known as smart contracts and organizations are known as DAOs (De-centralized Autonomous Organizations).
