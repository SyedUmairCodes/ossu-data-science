The informal definition of an algorithm would be:

>An algorithm is any well defined computational procedure that takes an input and process it to give an output.

Algorithms can also be viewed as tools for solving complex computational problems and the problem statement is used to specify the input and output relationship and also the necessary steps that the procedure will need to take in order to give the required output.

> Examples of simple algorithms could be number sorting programs and number sequencing programs

A large number of sorting algorithms have been developed since sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is required by almost every program.

Choosing which sorting algorithm is best for your required case depends upon multiple factors and how many items you need to sort, restrictions, and the kind of hardware being used to run the algorithm program are also factors that need to be considered.

>Algorithms are considered to be correct if every input instance returns the correct output.

Defining algorithms is easy and can be done in any language that we humans can speak but are mostly defined as computer programs and hardware designs. 

The only requirement for defining algorithms is that the required specification must provide a easy to understand and precise description of what the computational procedure must be used in the algorithm.

# Solving Problems with Algorithms

Algorithms aren't only used for sorting numbers and are used in multiple practical use cases.

- The Human Genome Project, whose goal is to identify every gene in the human body uses complex algorithms to sort, analyze, and store more than 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up the human DNA.
- The Internet that we all use to quickly upload and access information from all around the world also uses algorithms to manage the vast amounts of data.
- E-commerce websites and platforms use algorithms to keep the users passwords and billing details secure by using cryptography and digital signatures which are based on algorithms and number theory.

Whatever the problem statement may be there are multiple types of algorithms that can be used but not all of them are going to work 'exactly' the way we want it to work and finding the right algorithm for the job can be quite a challenge.

# Data Structures

Data structures are ways to store and organize data for easier and quicker access for modifications. There isn't a single data structure that can work like a jack of all trades so it's recommended to know the pros and cons of each of them before picking one.

# Algorithms as a Technology

Modern computers and memory is cheap and you would think that if this is true then you shouldn't need to study algorithms. 

If you think like that then you're extremely wrong because even if modern computers are fast but they're speed isn't infinite and even if memory is much more cheaper and faster now it is still limited to the amount that you have in your machine.

Algorithms aren't just used to determine solutions to complex computational problems but are used to determine the correct method for solving a given computational problem statement and you would always want to use the method that is the most easiest to implement and uses your resources the most wisely and algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space help you do so.

Different algorithms that are created to solve the same problem often times give different results due to not being efficient and this can be caused by what steps do each of the algorithms take to process the input and what hardware and software are they running on.
