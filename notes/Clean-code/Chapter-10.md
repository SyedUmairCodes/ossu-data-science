Kent Beck, The author of Simple Design quotes that there are only four rules that a system has to follow in-order to be simple and by following these rules your code could be well-structured and clean as well as you would gain more insights into your code.

These four rules are as follows:

- Your code must run through all the tests.
- It contains no duplication and is DRY.
- The developer was able to express his intent.
- It uses only the required number of classes and methods.

The first rule highlights the importance of testing in software development. If your code is perfect on paper and runs well in production but still you don't have any type of proof that your code will keep running smoothly without any problems. 

Testing is the proof that verifies the claims of the developer that his code runs without any problems.

Once we have tests, we are empowered to keep our code and classes clean. We do this by incrementally refactoring the code.

Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system. It represents additional work, additional risk, and additional unnecessary complexity.

The majority of the cost of a software project is in long-term maintenance. In order to minimize the potential for defects as we introduce change. 

As the systems become more complex, they take more and more time for a developer to understand, and there is an ever greater opportunity for a misunderstanding.

> Our goal is to keep our overall system small while we are also keeping our functions and classes small.
