Like functions, you should keep your classes small and shouldn't put too much responsibility on a single class. A class shouldn't have to call more than five methods at most.

A nice and clean class starts from the name. The name of the class shouldn't to bee too long or too short, The name of the class should be enough to explain what the class does.

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.

> Organize your classes and code in such a way that changes don't cost much technical debt to your team. 

We want to structure our systems so that we muck with as little as possible when we update them with new or changed features. 

In an ideal system, we incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making modifications to existing code.
