Choosing good variable names is a crucial part of writing clean code. The name of the variable should explain what that variable was created for.

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. 

If you don't name your variables correctly you'll end up creating problems for yourself, avoid using noise words when naming variables, names like `ProductInfo` and `ProductData` mean the same thing and if used for different things they lose their purpose. 

Same as noise words the word variable itself should not be a part of a name, your variable names should be pronounceable, if you have an error in your code and you want help then easily pronounceable words are better than gibberish.

## Naming Class and Objects
Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase in them. Avoid words like Manager, Processor,Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment` , `deletePage` , or `saveAccessors`.

> Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.
