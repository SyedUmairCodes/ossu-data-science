Data mining involves using statistical analysis methods to find meaningful patterns in data. These patterns can be clusters, dependencies, or anomalies.

Data mining processes can be automated to some extent, but it's important to remember that big data is a complex concept, and the term can be misleading.

Data mining is not about extracting data itself, but rather about extracting knowledge from large datasets. This knowledge can be used to improve business processes, make better decisions, and provide better customer service.
