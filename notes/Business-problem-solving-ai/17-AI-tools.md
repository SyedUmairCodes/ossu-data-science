## Ever-evolving Tech
The field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is constantly evolving, with new tools and technologies emerging all the time. These new developments have the potential to significantly improve the performance of ML models, especially those that attempt to mimic nature.

However, new tools and technologies can also introduce challenges, such as increased hardware requirements and project complexity. To ensure consistent results and code compatibility, it is important for all team members to use the same software versions.
