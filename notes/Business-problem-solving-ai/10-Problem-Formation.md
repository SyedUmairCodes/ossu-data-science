Problem formulation is a crucial step in implementing machine learning solutions. It guides the selection of input data, machine learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics.

Machine learning is defined as a computer program that learns from experience (E) to improve its performance at a specific task (T), as measured by a performance measure (P).

Framing the problem involves clearly defining the task, experience, and performance measure. Identifying the reasons for solving the problem helps in evaluating results, making appropriate compromises, and determining success.

Considering the lifetime and utilization of the solution helps determine its polish, support requirements, and deployment needs. 

Documenting assumptions about data sources, operating requirements, business context, and reference problems is essential. Determining whether the problem is better suited for AI or ML helps choose the appropriate approach.
