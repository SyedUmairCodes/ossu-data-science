AI and Machine learning need useful data to solve business problems, useful data can only come from translating raw data into actionable intelligence.

The hierarchy can also be expanded by including wisdom on top of knowledge. To get to the top of the DIK or DIKW pyramid we first need various data points that need to be organized and interpreted to be meaningful to the organization so that important data can be transformed into information.
