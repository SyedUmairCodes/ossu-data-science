When determining whether a business problem is a suitable candidate for an AI or ML solution, consider the following guidelines:

* Is enough data related to the task available to train the model. 
* Can the problem be isolated from other processes. Or, is it a part of another or multiple processes.
* Can you easily explain why the problem requires an AI or ML based solution and if so, can the AI model's answer be explained in detail as well.
* How much accuracy is needed from the model.
* Is the solution going to be about automation or requires ML capabilities.
