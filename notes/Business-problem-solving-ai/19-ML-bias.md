## Observer Bias

Observer bias is a phenomenon that occurs when our preconceived notions influence how we perceive and interpret information. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions and decisions that can have significant negative consequences.

One example of this is the work of Cyril Burt, whose research on intelligence and genetics was later discredited due to observer bias. It is important for researchers to be aware of their own biases and to take steps to minimize their influence on their work.

## Prejudice Bias

Prejudice bias is a type of bias that can occur in machine learning models when the training data is influenced by cultural or other stereotypes. This can lead to models that make unfair or inaccurate decisions, particularly when used to make critical decisions that affect people's lives.

To avoid prejudice bias, it is important to carefully consider the data used to train machine learning models. This includes ensuring that the data represents an even distribution of diverse groups and avoiding the use of proxies for protected classes of people.
