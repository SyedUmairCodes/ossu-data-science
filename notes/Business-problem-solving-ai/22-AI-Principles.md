## Humanitarian Principle
The rapid development of AI technologies presents both opportunities and challenges. While AI has the potential to benefit humanity in various fields such as healthcare, agriculture, and others, it also poses risks in terms of transparency, privacy, job displacement, disinformation, cybersecurity, disparity, weaponization, and unintended consequences.

It is crucial to address these risks through international cooperation, governance, ethical development, and careful testing to ensure that AI is used for the common good and not to the detriment of humanity.

## Asilomar Principles
The Asilomar AI Principles are a set of guidelines for the research and development of artificial intelligence (AI). These principles were developed by a group of AI researchers and organizations at the Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI in 2017.

The principles cover a wide range of topics, including the goals of AI research, the ethics and values of AI, and longer-term issues such as the potential for AI to pose existential risks to humanity.
