Big data is massive quantities of data generated from just about everyday business operations. It requires computational intervention to be translated into actionable intelligence.
 
The data must be translated into actionable intelligence, using ethical, new and emerging technologies and methodologies. There are many sources of big data, such as the Internet of things, Web and mobile, APIs, social media platforms and MAWR.

> MAWR stands for "Machine-Assisted Workload Reduction". It is a concept that refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate tasks and reduce the workload of humans.
## Characteristics of Big Data
Big data is characterized by three main factors: volume, velocity, and variety.

* **Volume:** Big data refers to massive amounts of data, often measured in petabytes, terabytes, and gigabytes.
* **Velocity:** The speed at which data is generated and processed is known as velocity. Data can be processed in batches, periodically, near real-time, or real-time.
* **Variety:** Big data encompasses a wide range of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

> Veracity is often considered a fourth V of big data. Veracity refers to the accuracy and reliability of data. 

## Big Data and it's Challenges

Anonymizing data becomes more challenging in big data scenarios due to the vast amounts of data and the capabilities of AI and ML. Larger volumes of data provide more clues that can be used to identify individuals. 

AI and ML can extract meaningful information from seemingly meaningless data, enabling re-identification of individuals through facial features, bio-metric patterns, and personal data.

Even simple data mining techniques, such as inference attacks, can allow attackers to gain knowledge about individuals from clues in the data set. As AI and ML capabilities continue to improve, data anonymization will become increasingly difficult.
