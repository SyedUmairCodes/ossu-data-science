Natural language processing (NLP) has become an integral part of our lives, but its use raises several critical ethical concerns.

* NLP applications should not exclude users based on language, hearing ability, or other factors.
* Developers should ensure that NLP technologies respect user privacy by avoiding practices like listening in on conversations or perusing messages without consent.
* NLP chatbots can be misused to spread misinformation, manipulate online discussions, and create distractions, making it necessary to consider regulations that require chatbots to identify themselves or ban them outright.

This raises concerns about the potential misuse of data, as the power company's intention to provide detailed power usage information could be exploited for unintended purposes. 

> As more people gain access to machine learning technologies, organizations must take every precaution to protect the data they collect.
