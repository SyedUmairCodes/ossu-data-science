Machine learning models are like math equations that can be used to make decisions or predictions. They are created by analyzing data and learning from patterns. These models can be used in many different fields, such as medicine, business, and farming.

A machine learning model could be used to help doctors choose the best treatment for a patient, suggest product prices that will help sell more items, or keep track of crops and tell farmers when to add fertilizer or water.

## Models and Outcomes

* Regression is used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input variables.
* Classification is used to identify the class or category to which a new data instance belongs.
* Clustering is used to identify clusters or groups of data points without any prior knowledge of the dataset structure.
* Dimensionality reduction is used to eliminate unnecessary input variables from a machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Workflow
Machine learning projects follow a general workflow that involves defining the problem, gathering and preparing data, selecting and training a model, applying the model, and presenting the results.

AI and machine learning projects often require different skill sets than traditional  IT or software development projects. These projects rely heavily on data, so, data science skills are essential.

Traditional IT skills are also important, especially when deploying and maintaining AI or machine learning solution. In some cases, hardware expertise may be needed, and new skill sets may be required to set up and manage these systems.
