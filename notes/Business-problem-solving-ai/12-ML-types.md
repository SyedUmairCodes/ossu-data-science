Machine learning can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning.

* In supervised learning, the machine is trained on a dataset with labeled examples.
* In unsupervised learning, the machine is given a dataset without labels and must find patterns on its own.

> Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the machine is given a dataset with some labeled and some unlabeled examples.

Supervised learning is typically used when there is a labeled dataset available, and the goal is to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning is typically used when there is no labeled dataset available, and the goal is to discover patterns or organization within the data.

> Semi-supervised learning is a good option when labeling allthe data is not feasible, but labeling some of the data can improve the performance of the model.
