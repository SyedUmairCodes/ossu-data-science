Machine learning is based on the mathematical fields of statistics and probability. Statistics analyze randomness within past events, while probability builds upon patterns identified by statistics to predict future events. 

Machine learning models are often described as stochastic, meaning that they are based on randomness and cannot perfectly predict individual data samples. To reduce uncertainty in machine learning models, you can use probability to your advantage. 

This can be done by getting more variety in the data and algorithms used, making sure the data is clean and correct, and using random number generation. Pseudorandom number generators are often used in machine learning to produce a sequence of numbers that appear random but are deterministic.

Providing the same seed value to the random number generator will always produce the same sequence of random numbers, which is often purposely done in machine learning to ensure consistent results.
