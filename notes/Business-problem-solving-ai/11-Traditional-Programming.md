Traditional programming and machine learning both involve algorithms, but the process of developing a solution is different.

* In traditional programming, the programmer analyzes the problem and develops an algorithm specifically written to solve it.
* In machine learning, the programmer determines the type of task to be performed and assembles an example dataset.

The programmer then selects an appropriate learning algorithm and sets the machine in motion with the dataset. After the machine produces a solution, the programmer evaluates its performance on a different dataset and adjusts if necessary.

Learning algorithms are typically statistical approaches that reveal patterns within the dataset that can later be used to make predictions. Machine learning is often described as being data-driven because the dataset plays a prominent role in training the machine to solve the problem.
