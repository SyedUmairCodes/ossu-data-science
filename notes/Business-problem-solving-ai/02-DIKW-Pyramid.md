Raw data is some times in such forms that it's impossible for humans to understand it. It needs to be processed and then transformed into information that can be understood by humans for further processing.

Information is the data that has context to it since it has been organized and interpreted to be meaningful and is used to guide the organization towards actionable steps that can be used to design and deploy solutions to the problems that the organization is facing.

Information can be further transformed into knowledge and knowledge is gained when we combine information with experience and the insights that we found from the information.

It is also known as actionable intelligence and can be used to respond to problems immediately or create counter measures for them before they even occur.

Knowledge plus experience adds another level on top of the hierarchy pyramid known as wisdom. Wisdom builds upon knowledge and is the product of the DIKW process.
