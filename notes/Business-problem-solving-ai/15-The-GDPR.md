The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires organizations to follow the principles of privacy by design, which means that privacy should be considered throughout the entire development life cycle of a software application.

* Data privacy should be considered early and often throughout the development process, not just after there is a problem.
* As initially installed, the application should be as private as possible. Users should have to opt in to decrease their privacy settings.
* Privacy should be built into the design of the software. It should be explicitly included in processes like requirements identification, threat modeling, user interface design, testing, and so forth.
* Customers value privacy, and it is part of the value that they pay for it
* Privacy protections should follow the data wherever it goes, from when it is first created to when it is archived and deleted.
* Privacy practices should be clear and overt, so users can have confidence in their privacy expectations.
* Users own their data. Data held in the software should be accurate, and the user must have the power to correct errors. The user can grant and revoke consent for the use of their data.

## The GDPR and Machine Learning
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and machine learning have some fundamental principles that seem to be at odds with each other.

The GDPR emphasizes data minimization, transparency, and user control, while machine learning often requires large amounts of data, opaque decisionmaking processes, and liberal data usage. In practice, these principles can be balanced to create effective machine learning models that comply with data privacy regulations.
