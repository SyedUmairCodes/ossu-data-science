Data privacy is a complex issue that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Different functions within an organization, such as legal, IT, and intelligence, each have unique expertise and perspectives on data privacy.

To effectively manage data privacy, these different functions must collaborate to identify applicable laws and standards and implement policies, practices, and tools that align with the organization's overall data privacy objectives.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is now capable of producing creative works, which raises complex questions about intellectual property (IP) rights. Traditional IP laws were designed for human creativity, but AI generated works introduce new challenges.

Organizations need to understand the evolving IP landscape and consider the ethical and legal implications of AI-generated creativity.
