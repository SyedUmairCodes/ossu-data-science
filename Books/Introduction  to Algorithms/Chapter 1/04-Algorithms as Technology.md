Modern computers and memory is cheap and you would think that if this is true then you shouldn't need to study algorithms. 

If you think like that then you're extremely wrong because even if modern computers are fast but they're speed isn't infinite and even if memory is much more cheaper and faster now it is still limited to the amount that you have in your machine,

Algorithms aren't just used to determine solutions to complex computational problems but are used to determine the correct method for solving a given computational problem statement and you would always want to use the method that is the most easiest to implement and uses your resources the most wisely and algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space help you do so.

Different algorithms that are created to solve the same problem often times give different results due to not being effeicint and this can be caused by what steps do each of the algorithms take to process the input and what hardware and software are they running on.
