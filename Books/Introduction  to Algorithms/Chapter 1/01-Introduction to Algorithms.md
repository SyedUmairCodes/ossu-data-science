# Introduction to Algorithms
The informal definition of an algorithm would be that:

>An algorithm is any well defined computational procedure that takes an input and process it to give an output.

Algorithms can also be viewed as tools for solving complex computational problems and the problem statement is used to specify the input and output relationship and also the necessary steps that the procedure will need to take in order to give the required output.

> Examples of simple algorithms could be number sorting programs and number sequencing programs

A large number of sorting algorithms have been developed since sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is required by almost every program.

Choosing which sorting algorithm is best for your required case depends upon multiple factors and how many items you need to sort. Restrictions, and the kind of hardware being used to run the algorithm program are also factors that need to be considered.

>Algorithms are considered to be correct if every input instance returns the correct output.

Defining algorithms is easy and can be done in any language that we humans can speak but are mostly defined as computer programs and hardware designs. 

The only requirement for defining algorithms is that the required specification must provide a easy to understand and precise description of what the computational procedure must be used in the algorithm.
