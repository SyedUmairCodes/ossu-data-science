Algorithms aren't only used for sorting numbers and are used in multiple practical use cases.

- The Human Genome Project, whose goal is to identify every gene in the human body uses complex algorithms to sort, analyze, and store more than 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up the human DNA.
- The Internet that we all use to quickly upload and access information from all around the world also uses algorithms to manage the wast amounts of data.
- E-commerce websites and platforms use algorithms to keep the users passwords and billing details secure by using cryptography and digital signatures which are based on algorithms and number theory.

Whatever the problem statement may be there are multiple types of algorithms that can be used but not all of them are going to work 'exactly' the way we want it to work and finding the right algorithm for the job can be quite a challenge.
