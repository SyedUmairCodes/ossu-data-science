Databases, caching, message queues all are different tools but are somewhat similar to each other. In recent times the boundaries that differentiate data tools has been blurred to the point that all kinds of data related tools fall under the umbrella term of data systems.

Modern applications have wide-range of requirements when it comes to data that a single tool cannot handle and so the solution was to decouple each task with it's own tool and then join them together using code.

A database and caching layer can be connected together in order to separate the searching from your main database. The caching server needs to be synced with the main database every time a transaction happens or the search results in the app will be affected.

When you combine different tools in order to provide a service, you're most probably gonna provide an API that will hide these hard-parts from the clients and will only show them how they can implement your service in their applications.

A lot of factors come into play when you start designing systems that are going to be data-intensive. Some of the questions are as follows:

- How can we ensure that data remains safe and secure?
- How can we make sure the application's performance doesn't suffer while maintenance happens or an internal part gets degraded?
- How can we scale the application without huge downtime?

These are some of the questions that arise when you work with high-intensity data applications that just don't have a single answer to them. The answers will depend upon you and your teams experience and the requirements and dependencies that your system will have.
