Modern applications rely more on data then they do on the computing power of the platform they are running on. The raw computing power of today's powerful CPUs is rarely a factor that would limit the performance of modern applications.

The problems that do limit the performance is how the application is going to handle all of the complex data that it needs to show to the user. Since the data is going to be changing at a rapid pace.

Data-intensive applications are built from standard building blocks that provide the functionality that is commonly required in all most all types of applications that are data-intensive.

- Databases to store data.
- Caching Mechanism to speed-up data retrieval.
- Adding filters and keyword searches through search indexes.
- Handle processes asynchronously using stream processing.
- Batch process huge amount of data.

Selecting what database to use, how to implement caching and indexes, and how to handle batch and stream processing is the main problem. There isn't a single tool that can handle all of this so combining different tools is the way to go but which tool should be combined with which can be really hard to decide.
