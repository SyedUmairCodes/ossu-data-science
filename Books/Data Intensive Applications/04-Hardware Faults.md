One of the most common types of faults that occur in software systems is the hardware failing that the system is running on. The storage runs out, the processor isn't powerful enough, or the RAM is faulty or not enough.

The first response to solve these problems is to have a backup solution before the fault first appears. Have backup drives, backup power generators, more RAM available and CPUs that can be swapped easily.

Modern solutions to hardware faults are making backups on cloud services, so you can shift users from the local server to the cloud with minimal downtime if the local server ever stops working.

Cloud computing platforms lower the hardware faults so much that you can setup automatic servers that'll spin-up when the load on your application increases and shut down when the load decreases.
