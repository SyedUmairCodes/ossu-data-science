You can test the performance of your system by manually adding load on it to see how the other components of the system act when a single parameter is increased. This also tells you an exact amount of resources that you're going to need when this increase happens in production.

Different systems will have load on different parameters and will require different approaches to handle the load.

> In batch processing the throughput is the most important factor, in a web app it's the response time of an API request.
