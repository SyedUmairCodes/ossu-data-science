Faults in the applications code base are also common if the development team didn't test the code or the code was written in a way that also had drawbacks.

Lagging, unresponsiveness, memory leaks, etc. All are software based faults that can happen in any system and their isn't any quick fix to these since the reason has to be found first as to why the fault is happening and then what's the reason the fault is getting triggered.

All of this cannot be fixed easily since the code has to be re-written, re-tested, and re-deployed to the application's server so that the fault can be fixed.
