# Introduction to SQL
The SQL language is the standard language for interacting with databases since the 70's and has a lot of features built-into it but we mostly use only a subset of them. SQL commands are categorized in different groups based on there uses. 

- DDL: Defines tables and new databases (schema)
- DML: Change, add, remove content
- TCL: Group transactions
- DCL: Assign data access to users

DML allows you to define the structure of your database the DML allows you to read, edit, and store new data inside the database. TCL allows you to run advance commands like group edits and DCL allows you to choose which users get access to what data.
