# Introduction to Databases
A database is a place to store important information in a computers storage. Databases are everywhere. Whenever you see the price of something on amazon or you purchase something you're interacting with a database. When you're seeing the price you're reading the stored data and when you make a purchase you're storing data in the database through your transaction.

Before databases were common software managed data using the file-based approach. Each application would store it's data in it's own custom files and this can cause many problems such as data overlapping in which multiple applications are storing the same data but aren't aware of each other. This can also cause inconsistencies in the data being stored.

One other problem with this would be that there will be a need for keep writing code for each application that we make it would just overlap like the data.

Databases and Database management system are what solved all these problems. All of the data is stored in a single location inside the database and every application can now access it using a unified interface and if one application updates the data it will be updated for every other app as well so every application has up to date data available at all times.
